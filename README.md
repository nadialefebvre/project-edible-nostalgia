# Project Edible nostalgia

Final project for Technigo's bootcamp, weeks 21-24: build a fullstack website

## Overall idea

Web app for recipes associated with memories built as my final project for Technigo's bootcamp. The idea was to store these recipes not already on the internet that are passed to you by your grandmother for example, and that each single recipe page is looking fine (without image for example) to be able to print them (in PDF to share or on paper).

Unregistered users have access to public recipes. They can't add, edit, rate them.

Registered users can edit/delete their profile, add a recipe and make it public or not, edit/delete their own recipes, give a rating to any recipe.

Recipe cards can be filtered by title/category on the "all" page.

There is a list of links to recipes in the profile page where the user can decide if they want to see only their recipes or all recipes, and sort them by many properties.
